One-Click drop-dead simple plugin allows you to install multiple plugins and themes from single zip archive.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to install all of your favorite themes and plugins in one go whenever you want.
Many WP site creators and developers have a "set" of favorite plugins, and/or themes, which they like to install on every new WP installation they do (or add to every existing WP site they acquire).
With this plugin, you do not need to upload and install each of your favorite plugins one at a time. 
Instead, you can add all your favorite plugins (or themes), to a single zip archive you create on your local computer, and then just use this plugin to upload that single file, extract it, and install all the plugins you included in it, all seamlessly from your WP Dashboard.

For example, I like to add 6 different plugins to any site I create. So, I have made a zip archive containing all 6 plugins, and named it pluginpack.zip.
Every time I install WP, I install and activate this Simple Installer plugin, and then, in my dashboard, I navigate to pluginpack.zip on my local computer, select it, and the zip will get uploaded, extracted, and all 6 plugins will be installed for me.
Works exactly the same way for themes.

== Installation ==

1. Take all the plugins you commonly add to your new WP installations, and create an archive (zip) file containing them all on your local computer.
Do the same with all your favorite themes.
2. Upload `SimpleThemesandPluginsInstaller.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. In your Wordpress dashboard, use this plugin to browse to your archive files containing your plugins and/or themes, select and upload.
5. Done!
